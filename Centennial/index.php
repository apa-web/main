17th House Centennial Celebration<br>
<br>
DECEMBER 4-6, 2015<br>
<br>
Brothers,<br>
<br>
In the fall of 1915, seven college men of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Incorporated came together and on November, 28th 1915 ignited the Light of Alpha in the Boston, Massachusetts area with the chartering of Sigma Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity. These brothers – Matthew W. Clair, Earl H. Crampton, James D. McLendon, Franklin A. Myers, Aiken A. Pope, Alford H. Tavernier and Lorenzo D. Turner founded the 17th House of Alpha and started it on a journey of what has been a very rich tradition and proud heritage. Many “Sons of Sigma” have passed through the doors of this chapter and each has played a part in building the rich legacy of Brotherhood, Leadership, Scholarship and Community that Sigma Chapter has maintained over the past 97 years. On November 28th, 2015, Sigma Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha will be celebrating 100 years of existence and the beginning of a 2nd century of success and influence in Alpha and in the Boston area.<br>
<br>
We, the 100th Anniversary Planning Committee extend fraternal greetings and joyful wishes with this correspondence. We would like to take this moment to inform you that plans are already in progress for a celebration to recognize the momentous Centennial Anniversary of our beloved Sigma Chapter.<br>
<br>
We look forward to having all the Sons of Sigma come and gather in Boston the weekend of Dec 3th – Dec 6th 2015. We will enjoy a host of activities to recognize this important anniversary, celebrate the history of The 17th House, rekindle the memories of College Days, and connect with the Brotherhood, past and present. Additional information will be forthcoming as plans are developed but please make a note of this very important upcoming event and save the date.<br>
<br>
We hope that you will able to attend so that we can celebrate this significant and special moment for The 17th House and as always, Brothers will have a chance to “.. enter, shake hands, exchange greetings and depart friends…”<br>
<br>
Fraternally,<br>
The Sigma Chapter 100th Anniversary Planning Committee<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
