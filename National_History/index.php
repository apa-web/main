					Since its founding on December 4, 1906, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. has supplied voice and vision to the struggle of African-Americans and people of color around the world.</br></br>

					Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for African-Americans,
was founded at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York by seven college men who recognized the need
for a strong bond of Brotherhood among African descendants in this country. The visionary founders,
known as the "Jewels" of the Fraternity, are   Henry Arthur Callis, Charles Henry Chapman, Eugene Kinckle Jones,
George Biddle Kelley, Nathaniel Allison Murray, Robert Harold Ogle and Vertner Woodson Tandy, 
The Fraternity initially served as a study and support group for minority students who faced racial prejudice,
both educationally and socially, at Cornell. The Jewel founders and early leaders of the Fraternity succeeded in
laying a firm foundation for Alpha Phi Alpha's principles of scholarship, fellowship, good character, and the uplifting of humanity.
Alpha Phi Alpha chapters were established at other colleges and universities, many of them historically black institutions,
soon after the founding at Cornell. The first Alumni Chapter was established in 1911. While continuing to stress
academic excellence among its members, Alpha also recognized the need to help correct the educational, economic, political,
and social injustices faced by African-Americans. Alpha Phi Alpha has long stood at the forefront of the African-American
community's fight for civil rights through leaders such as: W.E.B. DuBois, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., Edward Brooke,
Martin Luther King, Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Andrew Young, William Gray, Paul Robeson, and many others.
True to its form as the "first of firsts," Alpha Phi Alpha has been interracial since 1945.

                        <b>Henry Arthur Callis</b> became a practicing physician, Howard University Professor of Medicine and prolific contributor to medical journals. 
                        Often regarded as the "philosopher of the founders," and a moving force in the Fraternity's development, he was the only one of the "Cornell Seven" 
                        to become General President. Prior to moving to Washington, D.C., he was a medical consultant to the Veterans Hospital in Tuskegee, Alabama. 
                        Upon his death in 1974, at age 87, the Fraternity entered a time without any living Jewels. His papers were donated to Howard's Moorland-Spingarn                           Research Center.

                        A university funeral was held with considerable Fraternity participation when he became the first Jewel to enter Omega Chapter in 1934. 
                        Described as "a Brother beloved in the bonds," Chapman was a founder of FAMU's Beta Nu Chapter. During the organization stages of Alpha Chapter, 
                        he was the first chairman of the Committees on Initiation and Organization.

                        exceeded those of all his successors in office. A versatile leader, he organized the first three Fraternity chapters that branched out from Cornel                           Beta at Howard, Gamma at Virginia Union and the original Delta at the University of Toronto in Canada. In addition to becoming Alpha Chapter's                                 second President and joining with Callis in creating the Fraternity name, Jones was a member of the first Committees on Constitution and                                    Organization and helped write the Fraternity ritual. 
                            Jones also has the distinction of being one of the first initiates as well as an original founder. His status as a founder was not finally                                established until 1952. 
                        He died in 1954.</br>

					<b>History of Alpha East</b></br></br>
History of the Eastern Region of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.<br><br>

Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. was founded on December 4, 1906 in Ithaca, NY, making what is now known as the Eastern Region,
the birth place of Alpha. The region comprises of 12 states covering the geographical areas between Virginia and Maine and also 
includes Bermuda and Germany. The Eastern Region was monumental to the expansion, development and sustainability of Alpha Phi Alpha, 
especially in its early stages. It was here that the fraternity was incorporated, held its first national convention and began 
expansion by establishing chapters on other college campuses such as Howard University, Virginia Union University, Yale University, 
Columbia University, University of Pennsylvania, among many others.
<br><br>
AlphaEast is also the home of the National Headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland. 
The region currently has 148 active chapters and over 3,000 active members. AlphaEast takes great pride in being "First of All, Leading the Way."
</br></br>
 
History of ONECA (Organization of New England Chapters of Alpha)<br><br>
The concept or "birth" of ONECA came about as the result of the Chapters in VA, who were the first of the Districts 
(of which there are 7 in the Eastern Region) to use an acronym to identify themselves. They chose the acronym VACAPAF,
 which stands for the Virginia Chapters of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity.<br><br>
During a "brain storming" session with other District II Chapters (as all Chapters were only known by a District number), 
Bro. Thomas Harris IV suggested the acronym of ONECA and later presented it at the following District II Conference. 
Bro. Harris was President of the BSL (Hartford Alumni) Chapter at the time, and after a vote around 1979-1980, 
the Organization of New England Chapters of Alpha (ONECA) was born.
<br><br>
There are 6 states that make up ONECA: CT, MA, RI, NH, ME, and VT. Instrumental Chapters in the foundation building along with BSL, were HAL (New Haven, CT), TIL (Springfield, MA), ZPL (Stanford, CT), EGL (Boston, MA) and AG (Brown University).
<br><br>
As we stand today, close to 30 years later, ONECA is still strong and vibrant in the Greater New England area with 15 Chapters performing the work of Alpha.
<br><br>
The whistle has sounded and the call is made: "ALL ABOARD! The ONECA Train is leaving the station and is coming through!"
